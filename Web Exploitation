IT IS MY BIRTHDAY:
  Downloaded Hello.exe and erase.exe files from this website: https://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/md5collision/  then changed them into pdfs and inserted them
  into the website

WHO ARE YOU:
  Downloaded an user agent switcher and switched my user agent to PicoBrowser //in progress

MATCH THE REGEX:
  Inspected source code and found a comment: // ^p.....F!?
  assumed it meant picoCTF, used as input and found the flag

FINDME:

  enter with the username as test and password as test!.
  there are two different ids:

  id=cGlj...VzX2Fs

  id=bF90aG...YmJhZTlhfQ==
  This looks like base64 so I intially put the second part as it had "==" which made it look like base64. I got this back ...y_25bbae9a} which looks like the end of a flag. 
  When you put both of the id's together you get the flag once you decode the base64.
